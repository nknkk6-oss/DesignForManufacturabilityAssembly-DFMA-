Design for Manufacturability and Assembly (DFMA) checklist that is specific to:

>>Cold chain critical spares (compressor, evaporator fan motor, door gasket, temperature sensor, PLC board, vacuum sealer, heater wire)

>>Cold chain food products (frozen pork, frozen fish, grated mozzarella, chilled beverages).

DFMA Checklist for Cold Chain Spares & Products

Design, Concept, Function, and Sensitivity to Variation

Cold chain Spares: Ensure component design (e.g., compressor casing, evaporator blade pitch) can tolerate manufacturing variation without affecting cooling efficiency or lifespan.

Cold chain Products: Frozen pork/fish cuts designed for consistent size/shape to fit standardized packaging; grated mozzarella shred size controlled to avoid uneven melting; beverage bottle shape ensuring compatibility with automated fillers and chillers.

Manufacturing and/or Assembly Process

Cold chain Spares: Verify that parts can be assembled into existing systems without excessive downtime (e.g., quick-connect fittings for sensors, plug-and-play PLC boards).

Cold chain Products: Ensure portioning, freezing, and packing processes fit current line speeds; minimize product handling to prevent thawing or bacterial growth.

Dimensional Tolerances

Cold chain Spares: Set tolerances for compressor shaft, gasket dimensions, and fan blade clearance to ensure energy efficiency and prevent vibration damage.

Cold chain Products: Consistent frozen pork steak thickness ±2 mm for even freezing; grated mozzarella particle size tolerance to maintain weight accuracy; beverage fill level ±2 ml.

Performance Requirements

Cold chain Spares: Compressor must maintain -18 °C for frozen and 0–4 °C for chilled zones under peak load; fan motor airflow to match evaporator KWH capacity; heater wire must prevent ice buildup without overheating.

Cold chain Products: Pork/fish must retain <0.5% drip loss on thaw; mozzarella must maintain stretch and melt; beverages must hold carbonation and flavor through shelf life.

Number of Components

Cold chain Spares: Reduce part complexity — e.g., integrated temperature probe with cable harness to avoid multiple connectors; modular vacuum sealer seals for quick changeovers.

Cold chain Products: Optimize packaging layers — e.g., remove unnecessary plastic inserts in mozzarella bags, use combined outer cartons for pork/fish.

Process Adjustments

Cold chain Spares: Allow for on-site calibration of sensors and PLC parameters without specialist tools; fan blade balancing during installation.

Cold chain Products: Adjust freezing dwell times based on load; calibrate slicers/graters for yield optimization.

DFMA for cold chain critical spares

The compressor unit must maintain the correct refrigerant flow and pressure to keep target temperatures. It is built through brazing, welding, and precision machining, with tight tolerances on pistons and seals. It operates continuously at -18°C under high load, requires calibration during assembly, and must be packaged in vibration-safe packaging with a sealed moisture barrier.

The evaporator fan motor needs to deliver the required CFM airflow for even cooling. Its manufacturing involves motor winding and rotor balancing, with shaft alignment being critical. It must operate reliably in cold, humid air. Assembly includes balancing and lubrication before fitting, and it is packed with anti-moisture silica gel.

The door gasket ensures seal integrity to prevent warm air ingress. It is made by extrusion or molding with consistent profile thickness, then trimmed to exact length during fitting. It must maintain its insulation seal at all times and be stored without bending or compression.

The temperature sensor (PT100 or thermocouple) must provide accurate readings within ±0.1°C for HACCP compliance. It is produced by fabricating and encapsulating the sensor element, with tight calibration tolerances to ensure stable signals in extreme cold. Calibration is verified before use, and it is packed with ESD and moisture protection.

The PLC control board must provide reliable logic control and I/O for temperature systems. It is made through PCB assembly, soldering, and testing, with fine solder joint tolerances. It runs continuously and undergoes firmware updates before installation. Storage must be ESD-safe.

The vacuum sealer is designed to create an airtight seal for food safety and shelf life. It is assembled with heating elements and aligned sealing jaws to ensure uniform sealing pressure. It must maintain seal integrity across different packaging films, and requires temperature control tuning. Storage should be dry, and shocks should be avoided.
